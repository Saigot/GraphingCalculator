==================

A combination of the Equation and Graphing repos, this project is a GUI java application providing a graphing Calculator


TODO:

*Add error handling for bad equations


*allow support for the special case where there is negation of a bracketed expression at the begining of the expression
eg "-(x+2)" but not "(x+2)-(2x+3)"

*make interface less cluttered
